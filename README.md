## Motivation

I had stickers on my mail box, or permanent marker, and they fell off/faded. I got sick of replacing them and wanted something more permanent.

## Parts Required

- 4x Countersunk M3 Bolts + Nuts 6mm+ suggested but depends on backing thickness.

## Instructions

Print the sign, mark and drill appropriate holes, and mount.
